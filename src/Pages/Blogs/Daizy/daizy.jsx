        <p className='text-lg font-medium pb-4'>It's been a tough year for everyone, and I'm no exception. I've been going through some difficult times, and it's been weighing heavily on me. I needed something to lift my spirits and bring some joy back into my life. So, when I heard about a trip to Darjeeling in June 2022, I jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p className='text-lg font-medium mb-4'>I was in Phelling, at a small and somewhat unpopular village in Sikkim. It's a beautiful place, with stunning views of the Himalayan mountains and a peaceful atmosphere. I was staying at a hotel with a terrace, and as the night falls, I find myself drawn to it.
</p>
<p className='text-lg font-medium pb-4'>As I sit on the terrace, looking out at the twinkling lights of the village below, I can't help but feel a sense of calm wash over me. It's been a long journey to get to this point, and I've been through a lot. But somehow, I've found my way back to myself.
</p>
<p className='text-lg font-medium pb-4'>Maybe it's the fresh mountain air, or the peaceful surroundings, but I feel more at peace than I have in a long time. I'm looking forward to my trip to Darjeeling, and I have a feeling it's going to be exactly what I need to rejuvenate my spirit.</p>
<p className='text-lg font-medium pb-4'>So here's to new adventures and finding our way back to ourselves. May we all find the peace and joy we need to keep moving forward.</p>
